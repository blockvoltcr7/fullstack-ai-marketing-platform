🔍 **Analyzing the Schema File (`schema.ts`)**

### 🌐 **Overview**
The `schema.ts` file defines **database schemas** for a PostgreSQL database using **Drizzle ORM**. Drizzle ORM lets you model 🛠️ your database tables and relationships in TypeScript, providing a convenient and type-safe way for managing database interactions.

### 🔑 **Key Components of the Schema**

1. **📥 Imports**
   - The code imports utilities like `pgTable`, `uuid`, `timestamp`, `text`, etc., from Drizzle ORM's PostgreSQL core. These are used to define the structure of the database tables.
   - It also imports `relations` to set up 🔗 relationships between tables, enabling you to define how tables relate to one another.

2. **🗂️ Table Definitions**
   Each `pgTable` function represents a **database table**. The schema specifies the structure of each table, including columns and relationships:

   - **📌 Projects Table (`projectsTable`)**:
     - Represents a project entity in the app.
     - Key fields include:
       - `id`: Unique identifier (🔑 `UUID`).
       - `title`: Project title (📝 `text`).
       - `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: 📅 Timestamps for tracking creation and updates.
       - `userId`: Refers to the user who owns the project.

   - **📌 Assets Table (`assetTable`)**:
     - Represents an asset related to a project.
     - Key fields include:
       - `id`: Unique identifier.
       - `projectId`: A foreign key linking the asset to the `projectsTable`.
       - `title`, `fileName`, `fileUrl`: Metadata describing the asset 📄.
       - `fileType`, `mimeType`, `size`: Detailed file info 📁.
       - `content`, `tokenCount`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Additional fields including 📅 timestamps for creation and updates.

   - **📌 Asset Processing Jobs Table (`assetProcessingJobTable`)**:
     - Represents a processing job related to an asset.
     - Key fields include:
       - `id`: Unique identifier.
       - `assetId`: Foreign key linking to `assetTable`.
       - `projectId`: Reference to the associated project.

   - **💳 Stripe Customers Table (`stripeCustomersTable`)**:
     - Represents a Stripe customer linked to a user.
     - Key fields include:
       - `id`: Unique identifier (🔑 `UUID`).
       - `userId`: Unique identifier for the user.
       - `stripeCustomerId`: Unique Stripe customer ID 🔗.
       - `createdAt`: 📅 Timestamp for record creation.

   - **📜 Subscriptions Table (`subscriptionsTable`)**:
     - Represents user subscription information.
     - Key fields include:
       - `id`: Unique identifier.
       - `userId`: Identifier for the user linked to the subscription.
       - `stripeSubscriptionId`: Unique Stripe subscription ID 🔗.
       - `createdAt`: 📅 Timestamp for record creation.

3. **🔗 Relationships**
   - The `relations` function is used to define **relationships** between tables.
   - **Projects Relations (`projectsRelations`)**:
     - `projectsTable` is related to multiple (`many`) assets, prompts, and generated content.
   - **Assets Relations (`assetRelations`)**:
     - Each asset is linked to a single (`one`) project.

4. **📝 Types**
   - **TypeScript types** are generated for each table to enable type-safe operations.
   - Types include:
     - **Select Types**: Represent the data structure when fetching rows from the table (e.g., `Project`, `Asset`).
     - **Insert Types**: Represent the data structure when inserting new rows into the table (e.g., `InsertProject`, `InsertAsset`).

### 🔄 **Relationships Explained**
- **One-to-Many Relationships**:
  - A project can have multiple assets, as defined by the `projectsRelations` object. The relationship is enforced via the foreign key (`projectId`) in the `assetTable`.

- **One-to-One Relationships**:
  - An asset processing job is linked to a single asset. This is defined using the foreign key (`assetId`) in the `assetProcessingJobTable`.

### 🛠️ **Drizzle ORM Specifics**
- **`pgTable()`**: Used to create a new table schema, specifying columns and their properties.
- **`relations()`**: Defines relationships between tables, ensuring **referential integrity** and enabling efficient queries.
- **Data Types** (`uuid`, `text`, `varchar`, `timestamp`): Specify the structure and constraints of each table column.

### 🌟 **Points of Interest**
- **UUID Fields**: Primary keys are usually defined as `uuid` with `.defaultRandom()`, ensuring each record has a unique identifier 🔑.
- **Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`)**:
  - `createdAt`: Defaults to the current timestamp when a record is created (`.defaultNow()`) 📅.
  - `updatedAt`: Automatically updates to the current timestamp when the record is modified (`.defaultNow().$onUpdate(() => new Date())`) 📅.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**:
  - Fields like `projectId` and `assetId` reference other tables. The `onDelete: "cascade"` setting ensures that dependent records are deleted if the referenced record is deleted 🚮.

### 💡 **Use Cases**
- The `projectsTable`, `assetTable`, and `assetProcessingJobTable` work together to manage projects, related assets, and any processing jobs associated with those assets.
- The `stripeCustomersTable` and `subscriptionsTable` are used to manage user payment information and subscriptions via Stripe 💳.

### 📋 **Summary**
- **Data Modeling**: Defines schemas for a PostgreSQL database in TypeScript, including tables for projects, assets, customers, and subscriptions.
- **Relationships**: Specifies relationships between tables, such as one-to-many (projects and assets) and one-to-one (asset processing jobs and assets).
- **Type Safety**: Uses TypeScript to ensure type-safe operations when interacting with the database, using types like `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert`.
