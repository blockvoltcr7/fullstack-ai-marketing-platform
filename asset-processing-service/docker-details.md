# Dockerfile Explanation

### 1. Base Image

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
```
````

- This line uses an official lightweight Python image (`python:3.9-slim`) as the base image.
- The `slim` version is a smaller image with minimal packages, which helps reduce the size of the final Docker image.

### 2. TODO Comment

```dockerfile
#TODO: INSTALL VIDEO EDITING TOOLS - Whisper
```

- This is a reminder to install additional tools (e.g., video editing tools like Whisper) in future iterations of the Dockerfile.
- Whisper is an AI-based tool for video processing, likely to be integrated later.

### 3. Set Working Directory

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

- The working directory inside the container is set to `/app`.
- All subsequent commands will be executed inside this directory.

### 4. Copy Project Dependency Files

```dockerfile
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock* /app/
```

- This line copies the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files from the local machine to the `/app` directory in the container.
- These files define the dependencies and environment settings for a Python project managed by Poetry.

### 5. Install Dependencies Using Poetry

```dockerfile
RUN pip install poetry \
    && poetry install --no-root
```

- **`pip install poetry`**: This installs Poetry, a Python dependency manager, inside the container.
- **`poetry install --no-root`**: This command installs all the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` without including the current project in the environment (i.e., `--no-root` skips installing the main application code).

### 6. Copy Application Code

```dockerfile
COPY . /app
```

- This command copies the entire codebase from the local machine to the `/app` directory in the container.
- It ensures that all application files (excluding those specified in `.dockerignore`) are available in the container.

### 7. Define the Container's Default Behavior

```dockerfile
CMD ["poetry", "run", "asset-processing-service"]
```

- The `CMD` command specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
- In this case, it runs the command `poetry run asset-processing-service`, which likely starts the main service of the application, defined in the Python project.

---

### 8. run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 asset-processing-service
```

### Summary

This Dockerfile sets up a Python environment with `poetry` as the dependency manager, installs the necessary packages from the `pyproject.toml` file, and starts the `asset-processing-service` when the container is launched. The `TODO` comment suggests that video editing tools (like Whisper) will be added later.
